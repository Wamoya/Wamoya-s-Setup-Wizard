## Installation
1. Clone this repository in your machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Wamoya/Woya-s-Wizard.git
$ cd Woya-s-Wizard
```
2. Give execution permissions to the setup script:
```bash
$ chmod +x setup.sh
```
3. Run the wizard:
```bash
$ sudo ./setup.sh
```

## Why would you want this?
My main goal with this project is to collect all the tools that I use in my Linux machine in one place, so that I can easily restore my system anywhen and anywhere to a "default" value.
Of course, you probably won't agree with all my choices here, and that's normal. You may download this software and customize it so that it fulfills your personal needs.

## TODO
- [ ] Add information about compatibility
- [ ] Fix the callouts in README.md
- [ ] Add a customization guide
- [ ] Add the interactive elements that the current license states as required for terminal applications.
